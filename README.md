Git repository of reproducability example for journal publication (Journal: [Res Synth Methods](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/17592887))

## Description
In the [paper](https://doi.org/10.1002/jrsm.1486), we investigate different machine learning methods for automatically classifying publications based merely on title and abstract information in the context of updates of systematic reviews. In particular, we compare deep learning approaches, which have recently become quite popular with conventional machine learning techniques.\
This repo provides examples of the source code and one data set to make the work understandable and usable for further research. The description and procedure of the individual code steps are summarized below under "Usage".
